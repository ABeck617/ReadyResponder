# Understanding the event view

When you're viewing an event, the information is broken down into a few different sections:

![event view summary](/images/helpdocs/eventview/event_view_summary.png)

For more information about a specific section, see:

- [Event Administration](#event-administration)
- [Event Details](#event-details)
- [Event Status and Personnel Summary](#event-status-and-personnel-summary)
- [Event Breakdown Tabs](#event-breakdown-tabs)

## Event Administration

The buttons to the left of the Event Details are the Event Administration options. From here, you can:

- **Return to Events:** go back to the main Events page
- **Edit Event:** edit the details for this event
- **New Task:** add a new task to the event
- **New Availability:** add someone's availability manually to the event
- **New Notification:** add a notification for the event

#### Example

## Event Details


At the top of the event page, you’ll see details about the event, including:

-   Title
-   Event start time
-   Event end time
-   Duration of event
-   Description of event
-   Code word for the event
-   Departments involved in the event

#### Example

## Event Status and Personnel Summary

Below the event details, you’ll see an event status, followed by a personnel
summary.

### Event Status

The event status is a manually-selected status. Event status options are:

-   Scheduled
-   In-session
-   Completed
-   Cancelled
-   Closed

Event status must be changed manually as the event progresses.

### Personnel Summary

The personnel summary gives you information about the people involved in the
event. The number in each color-coded box is the number of people with that
personnel status.

The colors mean:

-   **Green** = Available
-   **Yellow** = Partially Available (available for a portion of the event)
-   **Red** = Unavailable
-   **Gray** = No response from the individual

#### Example

![personnel summary](/images/helpdocs/eventview/personnel_summary.png)

In this example, the event is currently In-session, 2 people are available, 1 person is partially available, 2 people are unavailable, and 2 people have not replied.

## Event Breakdown Tabs

Below the Event Status and Personnel Summary, you’ll see a detailed breakdown of the event. This is a tabbed view that gives you details about:

-   [Tasks](#tasks)
-   [Availabilities](#availabilities)
-   [Notifications](#notifications)

### Tasks
Tasks are a list of objectives to achieve during an event. At a parade event, for example, tasks might include:
- Shutting down intersections
- Patrolling the route
- Setting up and staffing a staging area for checking in and out personnel and equipment.

In the Event Breakdown view, the Task tab gives you information about tasks for the event, including whether or not their requirements are met, and the status of the task.

#### Example

![event view tasks tab](/images/helpdocs/eventview/event_view_tasks_tab.png)

### Availabilities

The Availabilities tab lists personnel relevant to this event. This tab is broken down into two sections:

- Personnel who have responded to the event
- Personnel who have not responded to the event

The top part of the page lists people who have responded to the event with their availability details. This information is color-coded for easy identification. The colors mean:

- **Green** = Available
- **Yellow** = Partially Available (available for part of the event)
- **Red** = Unavailable

The bottom part of the page lists people who are eligible for the event, but have not responded. To be eligible for the event, a person:

- Must be a member of a department involved in the event
- Must be Active - not on medical leave, inactive or some other status

#### Example

![event view availabilities tab](/images/helpdocs/eventview/event_view_availabilities_tab.png)

### Notifications

From this tab, you can view information about notifications that have been sent out about an event. The details you'll probably want to note when you view this page are:

- Status: tells you whether a notification is in-progress, cancelled, scheduled or complete.
- Channels: tells you the form of the notification, such as text, email or phone call.
